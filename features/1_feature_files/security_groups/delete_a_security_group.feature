Feature: Delete a Security Group
  As an authorized user, I want to delete a security group

  From the OpenStack docs (http://goo.gl/wRnRh):
  A security group specifies which incoming network traffic should be delivered
  to the VM instances in that group. All other incoming traffic not specified
  by the security group is discarded. Users can modify rules for a group at any
  time. The new rules are automatically enforced for all running instances and
  instances launched from then on.

  Background:
    * A project exists in the system
    * Ensure that a user exists in the project
    * Ensure that a security group exist
