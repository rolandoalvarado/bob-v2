Feature: Delete an Image
  As a user, I want to delete an image in my project so that I can keep my list
  of images manageable

  From the OpenStack docs (http://goo.gl/vwNln):
  An image is a file containing information about a virtual disk that completely
  replicates all information about a working computer at a point in time
  including operating system information and file system information.
