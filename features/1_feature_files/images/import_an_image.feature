  Scenario: Add Meta-data on Import
    NOTE: Users should be able to add arbitrary meta-data when they create an
    image. This meta-data should be in key-value pairs. For example:

      - description='This is a copy of our web server'
      - version='2.0'

    Users should be able to specify any key and value. Thus, the meta-data is
    like a set of custom fields.

    * An authorized user can add meta-data when importing an image
