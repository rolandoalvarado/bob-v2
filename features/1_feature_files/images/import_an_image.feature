Feature: Import an Image
  As a user, I want to import an image so that I can re-use the images that I
  created from other cloud providers.

  NOTE: If this feature is tagged with '@future' then that means it's for a future
  release. Please remove this note once the '@future' tag has been removed.

        | Image Format |
        | Raw          |

  Scenario: Add Meta-data on Import
    NOTE: Users should be able to add arbitrary meta-data when they create an
    image. This meta-data should be in key-value pairs. For example:

      - description='This is a copy of our web server'
      - version='2.0'

    Users should be able to specify any key and value. Thus, the meta-data is
    like a set of custom fields.

    Given I am authorized to import images to the project
     Then I can add meta-data when I import an image
