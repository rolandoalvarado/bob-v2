Feature: Edit a Project's Instance Quota
  As a project manager, I want to set the instance quota (aka maximum
  number of instances) in my project, so that I can control my project's
  resource usage.

  User Experience Requirement:
  The quota check needs to happen before the system even attempts to launch
  the instance so that the user won't have to wait for a few minutes to find
  out that he's over the quota after all.

  June 5th: new mcloud has only 3 quota values. Floating IPs, Volumes and Cores
  So I create scenario only for them.
