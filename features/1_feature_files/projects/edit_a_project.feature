Feature: Edit a Project
  As an authorized user, I want to edit a project's details

  Ideally, a user who is not a system admin but is granted manager role in a
  project should have the ability to edit that project.
  #MCF-84 from WC 1.0.1 , project manager role does not depend on project.

  Background:
    * A new project exists in the system
    * A project does not have collaborators
