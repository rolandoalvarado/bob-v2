Feature: Assign a Floating IP to an Instance
  As a user, I want to assign a floating IP address to my instance, so that
  when my instance's fixed IP changes after a relaunch, I can still reach it
  through its assigned floating IP.

  From the OpenStack docs (http://goo.gl/KBb4B):
  Every virtual instance is automatically assigned a private IP address. You
  may optionally assign public IP addresses to instances. OpenStack uses the
  term "floating IP" to refer to an IP address (typically public) that can be
  dynamically added to a running virtual instance. OpenStack Compute uses
  Network Address Translation (NAT) to assign floating IPs to virtual instances.
