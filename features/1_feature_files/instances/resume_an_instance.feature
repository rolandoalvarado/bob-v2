Feature: Resume an Instance
  As a user, I want to resume a suspended instance so that I can use it again
  after I'm done doing any maintenance work on it.

  From the OpenStack docs (http://goo.gl/NtOfW):
  Suspending an instance frees up memory and vCPUS and can be compared to
  hibernating a machine. For more information on which hypervisors support
  suspension/resumption of an instance, see this page: http://goo.gl/3IRX3

  Background:
    * A project exists in the system
    * The project has 1 suspended instance
