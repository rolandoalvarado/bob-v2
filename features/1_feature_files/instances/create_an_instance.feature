Feature: Create an Instance
  As a user, I want to create instances in my projects so that I can
  deploy my applications (web apps, services, etc).

  The term "Instance" is synonymous with "Server Instance." An instance is
  created by launching a VM using a given machine image and machine flavor.

  Current restrictions:
  We have not implemented keypair, and security group selection system.

  Background:
    * A project exists in the system
    * At least 1 image should be available for use in the project
    * The project has 0 active instances
