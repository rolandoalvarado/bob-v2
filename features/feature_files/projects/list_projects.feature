Feature: List Projects
  As a user, I want to see all the projects that I have access to.

  From the OpenStack docs (http://goo.gl/DND5I):
  Projects are isolated resource containers forming the principal
  organizational structure within OpenStack Compute. They consist of a
  distinct set of VLAN, volumes, instances, images, keys, and members.

  Background:
    * A project exists in the system
