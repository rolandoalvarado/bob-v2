Feature: Add a member to a project
  NOTE: The term 'project' refers to a grouping of users and VMs in a given DCU
  This term combines 'organization' and 'cloud' from the old mCloud.

  This feature provides DCU administrators and project owners the ability to
  add users to a project. DCU administrators can add users to any project while
  project owners can only add users to their own project.
