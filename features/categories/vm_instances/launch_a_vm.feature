  This feature allows an authorized project member
  to launch a VM in a project.

  # Background:
  #   * A project named 'CMS' exists
  #   * The project has the following machine images available:
  #     | Machine Image |
  #     | Web Server    |
  #     | Database      |
  #   * Marjorie is a developer of that project
  #
  # Scenario: Launch a VM
  #   When Marjorie tries to launch a VM with the following attributes:
  #     | Image Type | Friendly Name | Tags             |
  #     | Database   | Production DB | marj, production |
  #   Then the system will launch the VM within 5 to 10 minutes
  #    And the VM will have the following attributes:
  #     | Friendly Name | Tags             |
  #     | Production DB | marj, production |
  #    And Marjorie should be able to SSH to it
