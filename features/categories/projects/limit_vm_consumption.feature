Feature: Limit a Project's VM Consumption
  A project owner needs to be able to limit the
  maximum number of VMs that his project may
  consume so that he can control the project's
  expenses.

  Background:
    * A project named 'Marketing' exists in the cloud
    * Robert Baratheon is a manager of that project
    * Arya Stark is an developer in that project

  Scenario Outline:
    Given Robert has set the project's Maximum VM Usage to <Limit>
      And there are <Starting> VMs in the project

     When Arya attempts to launch <New> VMs

     Then there will be <Total> launched VMs in the system
      And the UI will display '<Message>'

    Examples:
      | Limit | Starting | New  | Total | Message                      |
      |  10   |    0     |  10  |  10   | Launching 10 VMs             |
      |   5   |    0     |   4  |   4   | Launching 4 VMs              |
      |  15   |    5     |  15  |   5   | Project is limited to 15 VMs |
