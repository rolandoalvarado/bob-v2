mCloud Features
===============
This is an executable documentation of the features in the mCloud product suite. By executable, that means you can run it and it will be automatically verified against an existing mCloud installation. After verification, it will generate a [business-friendly progress report](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1355795/misc/progress_report.png).

Prerequisites
-------------
1. [Git](http://git-scm.com)
2. [Ruby](ruby-lang.org/) 1.9.2-p290 or higher

Additional Prerequisites for Mac OS X
-------------------------------------
1. Xcode 4.1+ or the [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
2. If you have Xcode 4.2 or above, you'll need to work around LLVM GCC. Here's [a suggestion](http://www.relaxdiego.com/2012/02/using-gcc-when-xcode-43-is-installed.html).

Installation
------------
1. `git clone git@bitbucket.org:wdamarillo/mcloud_features.git`
2. `cd mcloud_features`
3. `run/setup`

Usage
-----

To run mCloud Features:

    run/verifier

The above command will generate a report in the `output` directory.

To automatically run mCloud Features every time something changes in the feature or step files:

    run/autoverifier

Other useful commands
---------------------

Getting updates:

    run/updater

The above command will pull the latest changes from origin/master and run `setup`. If you want to pull changes from another remote or branch, use:

    run/updater <other_remote_repo> <my_branch>

To see a list of available commands:

    run/help


Found a bug?
------------
If you find a problem with the the verifier, report it [here](https://bitbucket.org/wdamarillo/mcloud_features/issues/new). If you find bugs on mCloud, please report it to Jira.

Contributing
------------
__NOTE:__ If you just plan on contributing to the .feature files every now and then, you may skip this section and write .feature files directly. Afterwards, submit it by emailing the .feature file to (email TBD) and someone will commit your file for you. If you plan on contributing on an ongoing basis, we highly recommend you follow this process.

1. Fork `https://bitbucket.org/wdamarillo/mcloud_features`
2. Create a branch for whatever it is you plan to do. ALWAYS create a branch so that when there are changes in origin/master, you only need to rebase your branch and keep your commits in order. Also, this allows you to squash multiple commits into one before submitting a pull request.
3. Change stuff
4. Send a pull request

How to write Features
---------------------
* Features are written as ordinary text files with a .feature extension under the `features` directory
* The simplest .feature file can be written as:

  Listing 1. Sample .feature file

      Feature: Launch a VM

        Scenario: Succesfully launch a VM
          Given a machine image exists
           When I try to launch it
           Then it should be online in 20 minutes

        Scenario: Gracefully fail
          Given a bad machine image exists
           When I try launch it
           Then the system should alert me by email
